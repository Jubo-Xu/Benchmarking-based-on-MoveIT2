# Benchmarking-based-on-MoveIT2
This is a ROS2 package that is mainly used for benchmarking. The package is the basic version which is used to compare different motion planning algorithms in different conditions. There are 15 test cases in total, and are tested under three scenarious: no obstacle(simplest case), with a single obstacle, and narrow space(a common case for robotics benchmarking). The comparison is accomplished for 5 planner architectures: OMPL(open library for basic sampling based motion planning algorithms), CHOMP, STOMP, OMPL+CHOMP(OMPL as pre-planner and CHOMP as post-optimizer), OMPL+STOMP. There are three important criterias for this benchmarking. The first one is time-consumption for generating plan, the second one is the metric of smoothness(calculated by finding the maximum difference between two adjacent discretized points of a trajectory), and the last one is whether the planning is successful or not. The time consumption and smoothness are shown as a marker above the robotic arm, and whether the planning is successful is noted in terminal.
